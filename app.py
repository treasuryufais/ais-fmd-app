# the top pill bar; three admin pages sit in the profile menu (top right) since
# 2026-11-08, when it replaced the sidebar and the "More" section. Merged pages are hubs
# (views/*Hub.py) that run the original, unchanged view files one at a time:
#
#   Dues          = Dues + Roster
#   Transactions  = Import + Transactions + Review Queue
#   Assistant     = Assistant + Runbook (as "Help")
#   Alerts & Data Quality = Alerts & Reports + Data Quality
#   Settings      = Officer Access + Audit Log
#
# MVP SCOPE. Reimbursements is commented out rather than deleted: the page, its
# domain module, its tests and its SQLite tables all still exist and still
# pass, and the Postgres side is waiting in migrations/002_deferred_features.sql.
#
# Officer Access, the VP portal's admin page, was deferred 2026-09-08 and turned
# back on 2026-10-26. It maps an email to a role and a committee, which is what
# Google sign-in looks up in `profiles`. In production that table comes from
# migration 013.
#
# `Officer.py` ("My Committee") is deliberately a primary page -- it is a
# read-only committee view that a treasurer outranks, and it stays available.
