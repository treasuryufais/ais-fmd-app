"""
Assistant guardrails: a VP never sees another committee's figures, and a
question the data cannot answer gets "I don't know" instead of a number.

Written by Jai against the first assistant, then carried onto Cameron's rewrite:
the attack prompts and the fixture are unchanged, and the assertions now use the
rewrite's `Scope` / `status` instead of `restrict_to_committee` / tool names.
