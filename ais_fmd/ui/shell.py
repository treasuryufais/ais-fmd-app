"""
Page shell: header, banner, metrics, empty states.

FINDING (consistency). Every page in the original invented its own introduction,
its own filter placement, and its own way of saying "no data". One shell means
a new page is consistent by default rather than by discipline.

FINDING (performance). `animated_typing_title` slept 20ms per character and
every page called it at the top. Streamlit re-runs the whole script on every
widget interaction, so each filter change cost about half a second of
deliberate delay plus one markdown re-render per character. It was first cut
down to once per session per title, and is now gone entirely: a title that
types itself is the single loudest tell that a piece of software was generated
rather than designed, and it bought nothing that the CSS entrance animation in
`theme` does not do in 400ms without blocking the script.

PEBBLE. Every header, card and metric fades and rises once via CSS
(ui/theme.py). Helpers added for it:

  card(name, order=)    a white rounded card; order sets the entrance delay
  heading(title, right) the title row inside a card
  legend(items)         dot-legend HTML for a heading
  html(markup)          inline HTML with dollar signs made LaTeX-safe
  hub(key, views)       several existing view files under one nav entry
  chart(..., reveal=)   charts that wipe in once on first render
  metric(..., bars=)    same-day values for recent terms, drawn in the tile

    A slider paired with a number input for exact entry, kept in sync.

    Dragging a slider is fast but imprecise; typing a number is precise but
    slow for exploring a range. Pairing them costs one extra widget and gives
    both -- and it bounds the value to `[min_value, max_value]` either way,
    which a bare `st.number_input` with no `max_value` does not: that gap is
    what let "expected members" on the Dues and Planner pages be typed or
    computed into values with no relationship to a real roster size.

    `key` must be unique per call on a page, same as any Streamlit widget key.
    Int-typed `min_value`/`max_value`/`value`/`step` produce an int slider;
    float-typed ones produce a float slider -- same type inference Streamlit's
    own `st.slider` uses, since this delegates to it.

    Syncing works by writing the *other* widget's session-state key directly
    from each one's `on_change` callback -- passing `value=` again on a later
    rerun would not do it, since Streamlit ignores `value` for a widget whose
    key already holds state and uses only what's in `st.session_state` for
    that key. Writing both keys in the callback is what makes the second
    widget actually move.

    `value=` is passed to each widget **only on the render where its key does
    not exist yet** (the very first one). Passing it on every render, even
    with the correct value, trips Streamlit's own policy check -- it logs
    "created with a default value but also had its value set via the Session
    State API" and warns that a future version may turn this into a hard
    error. The check exists for exactly this shape of bug, so the fix is to
    stop doing the thing it's warning about, not to ignore the warning.
