"""
Which pages a signed-in person can navigate to.

A VP (an Officer, see `Identity.committee_scoped`) gets four pages: their own
committee's dashboard, their own committee's transactions, their own committee's
plan, and the Assistant (see the note on `VP_PAGES`). Everything else -- including Home and other pages
that are open to any role, like the org-wide Dashboard and Transactions, all of
which show every committee -- is left out of their navigation, and Streamlit only serves pages
that are in the navigation, so a page that is not listed cannot be reached by
typing its URL either.

Kept out of `app.py` so it can be tested without running the whole app, and so
edits to the full `PAGES` list there do not conflict with edits here.
