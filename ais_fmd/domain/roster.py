"""
Module M21 -- the membership roster, and dues reconciliation against it.

The app could already report who *did* pay, recovered from transfer
descriptions. It had nothing to compare that against, so the question a
treasurer is actually asked -- "who still owes?" -- was unanswerable except by
typing a headcount into `dues.outstanding` and subtracting.

Everything here is pure. No I/O, no Streamlit.

WHY NAME MATCHING NEEDS ITS OWN MODULE
--------------------------------------
Three properties of the real Fall 2026 statement make the naive `payer == member`
comparison wrong often enough to be useless:

1. **Wells Fargo emits names in both orders.** The same file carries
   "ZELLE FROM CAMERYN WEITZ" and "ZELLE FROM SCHUCK JOHN" -- first-last and
   last-first, with nothing in the row to say which. Any comparison has to try
   both, which is what `name_variants` is for.

2. **People pay for each other, and say so in the memo.** "NICOLAS SANDERS ...
   CHARLIE ANDREWS DUES" is Nicolas paying Charlie's dues; crediting Nicolas
   twice and leaving Charlie unpaid is wrong on both counts. Parents pay for
   students ("BETH MCNAMARA ... KATE MCNAMARA DUES"), and one person may cover
   several members.

3. **Memos are noisy.** "SIA RAJPUT MS ISOM DATA SCIENCE FALL 2026" and
   "AIS DUES FOR ALEJANDRA ALZAMORA" carry a name inside prose.

The approach that survives all three is to search the memo **for roster members**
rather than to parse names out of it generically. The roster is a closed list, so
"does any member's name appear in this memo" is answerable exactly, where "what
name is in this string" is not. Beneficiary beats payer whenever both are found,
because a memo naming someone else is an explicit instruction about who the
payment is for.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
No fuzzy/edit-distance matching. A near-miss on a member name silently credits
the wrong person's dues, and a treasurer chasing someone who already paid --
or, worse, not chasing someone who has not -- is a worse outcome than a row
landing in "unmatched" for a human to resolve in seconds. Unmatched is a
first-class result here, not a failure.

        Unmatched payments paired with the unpaid member they probably belong to.

        Strictly a proposal. Nothing here is credited automatically, and that is
        the point: exact matching refuses "ZACKARY FLORENDO" against a roster
        reading "Zack Florendo", and refusing is right, because a matcher loose
        enough to accept it is also loose enough to credit the wrong person's
        dues. What a human can do in one glance is confirm it.

        The rule is prefix-per-token: every token of the member's name must be a
        prefix of, or equal to, some token in the payment. That accepts
        "Zack"/"Zackary" and "Rudd"/"Rudds" -- shortened forms and stray plurals,
