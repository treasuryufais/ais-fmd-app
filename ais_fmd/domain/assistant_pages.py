"""
Where things are in the app, for the assistant's `find_page` tool.

The assistant answers "where do I see X?" from this table rather than from a
model's guess, so it can never send someone to a page that does not exist or
that their role cannot open.

`tests/test_assistant.py` reads `app.py` and the hub files and fails if a page
here is renamed, removed, or has its role changed there. When the navigation
changes, update this table in the same pull request.

Roles are plain strings ("member", "officer", "treasurer", "admin") because
`domain/` must not import `auth` (which imports Streamlit).
