"""
Historical ledger parser -- recovers human labels from past treasurers' work.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Everything the system "knew" until now was its own output:
`budget_category` in the transactions table was written by `categorize_frame` at
import time, not by a person. Fitting anything to those labels would train the
model on itself. The Google Drive workbooks ("Temporary FMD", "Copy of AIS
Ledger Workbook") are different -- past treasurers typed the Budget and Purpose
columns by hand, covering Fall 2022 onward. That is genuine ground truth, and it
is the only genuine ground truth the project has.

WHAT TRANSFERS AND WHAT DOES NOT. The labels come with real bank descriptions,
so the same features can be derived from them. But the cards in that era
(0319, 6570, 8648, 2949) belong to officers who have since graduated; the
current roster is 8313/5718/3568/8408. A card weight fitted across both eras
would be meaningless. Every example therefore carries an `era`, and the fitter
scopes card features to it. Merchant names and description shapes -- WIX.COM is
Technology, VENMO CASHOUT is a transfer -- do carry across.

The workbooks are read as the Drive connector renders them: markdown tables.
Several sheets repeat the same rows in different shapes, so rows are keyed and
deduplicated rather than trusted to be distinct.
