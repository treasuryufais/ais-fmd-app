"""
The model pass -- batched, schema-constrained, and loud about failure.

Three findings are addressed here.

FINDING F8. The original wrapped the entire call in `except Exception: return []`,
so a missing key, a rate limit, a network error and malformed JSON all produced
an empty list that was indistinguishable from "the model matched nothing". The
treasurer saw an uncategorized table with no reason to retry. Failures are now
returned as a typed `LLMOutcome` carrying the error, and the UI surfaces it.

FINDING F9. Every transaction went into one unbounded prompt with no chunking,
so a large statement silently exceeded the context window -- and one malformed
response discarded the results for the whole file. Work is now chunked, and a
failed batch only loses that batch.

FINDING (cost). The prompt encoded seven rules, five of which were then
re-implemented in Python and always overrode the model. Only the residual --
rows no deterministic rule and no merchant memory could resolve -- reaches this
module now, and the prompt only describes the distinction that is genuinely
ambiguous.

SPEND REVIEW. A second, separate pass: `review_spend` asks whether a booked
transaction *fits* its committee, using config/spend_review_prompt.md as the
system prompt. It returns verdicts and never a category -- categorization and
spend review must not change each other's output.

In sandbox mode this module never makes a network call. `openai` is not even
installed in the sandbox venv.

You categorize bank transactions for a university student organization.

Deterministic rules have already been applied upstream. Every transaction you \
are given is one they could not settle: either nothing recognised it, or the \
evidence conflicts. When the rules noticed something, it is given as \
Upstream_Note -- read it first; it says what the conflict is.

Choose exactly one committee ID per transaction:
  1  Dues                    a member paying membership dues
  2  Treasury                bank fees, the treasurer's own operating costs
  3  Transfers               the chapter moving its own money between accounts
  4  President               president's discretionary spending
  5  Membership              bars, social venues, member social spending
  6  Operations              the VP of Operations' own committee spending (formerly Corporate Relations)
  7  Consulting              consulting-project costs, including catering its own events
  8  Meeting Food            groceries or restaurants bought for a general body meeting
  9  Marketing               advertising, flyers, design tools
  10 Professional Development  conferences, training, career events, headshots
  11 Sponsorship / Donation  money received from a sponsor or donor
  12 Overhead                general operating costs no committee owns
  13 Merch                   apparel, printing, promotional goods, or a member paying for them
  14 Road Trip               travel, lodging, transport, or a member paying for a trip
  15 Technology              software, hosting, domains, hardware
  16 Passport                the ISOM Passport program
  17 Refunded                money coming back from a merchant
  18 Formal                  the formal / semi-formal, or a member paying for a ticket
  0  Unknown                 genuinely cannot tell

Rules of thumb:
  - Weekday_Hint of Tuesday or Wednesday plus a food merchant suggests 8 -- \
but if the note says the card belongs to Consulting, a large order is often \
Consulting catering its own event. Only choose 8 over the card with a reason.
  - The VP of Operations' card buys mostly meeting food (8). Her own \
committee (6) gets the occasional rewards or appreciation outing -- a sit-down \
restaurant bill for a few people rather than a meeting-sized order.
  - A bar, brewery or liquor store is 5, never 8.
  - An incoming payment at a dues amount is dues unless its memo clearly says \
it paid for something else; then choose that.
  - Report confidence honestly. Anything under 0.75 is sent to a human with \
your suggestion, which is the right outcome when you are unsure.
  - When the transaction is unrecognisable, answer 0 rather than guessing.

Respond with JSON only: {"results":[{"index":<int>,"committee_id":<int>,\
