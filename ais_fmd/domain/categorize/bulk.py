"""
Module M4b -- bulk merchant proposals (P3).

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Merchant memory works, and is empty. Working it one
row at a time through the review queue means 330 decisions. Grouping the same
rows by merchant turns that into 97 decisions, each of which is permanent: once
"PUBLIX GAINESVILLE" is mapped, every future Publix row resolves for free.

THE COST ARGUMENT. The original Colab script sent every transaction to a model
on every run and then overrode most of its answers in Python. This module asks
the question at the *merchant* level instead of the row level, and persists the
answer:

    330 rows/run, every run   ->   97 merchants, asked once, then never again

WHAT THIS MODULE WILL NOT DO. It proposes; it does not decide. Which committee a
merchant books to is a judgement about real money -- the same class of decision
as the disputed purpose mappings in §8 of the handoff. Every proposal carries
its evidence and a confidence, and `needs_decision` is true for anything the
deterministic signals cannot settle. Writing to the merchants table is a
separate, explicit step that only accepts rows a human has confirmed.

TWO POPULATIONS. The residual is not one thing:

  * ~210 rows are card purchases with a stable merchant name -> merchant memory.
  * ~120 rows are incoming Zelle payments from members, which `merchant_key`
    deliberately refuses to learn from (a rule keyed on a member's name would
    mis-categorise everything else that person ever pays). But their *memo*
    often says what the payment was for -- "HOODIE TSHIRT", "HEADSHOT" -- and
    nothing was reading it. Those are grouped by memo keyword instead.
