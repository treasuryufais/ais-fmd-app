"""
Duplicate detection.

FINDING F3. The original key was (details, date). Venmo rows survived that
because their details string embeds a transaction ID, but Wells Fargo details
are the raw bank description -- so two genuine purchases at the same merchant,
same day, same amount collapsed into one and the second was silently dropped.

The naive fix (add amount to the key) trades one failure for another: it stops
losing data, but it also stops catching re-uploads of a file containing a
genuinely repeated charge.

The key carries an **occurrence ordinal**, assigned batch-locally from zero, and
matching uses multiset semantics: a row is a duplicate when its ordinal falls
within the count already stored for that identity. So:

  * Two real $4.50 coffees on the same day, nothing stored: ordinals 0 and 1,
    both beyond the stored count of 0, so both import.
  * Re-uploading that statement: the same two rows get ordinals 0 and 1 again,
    both now within the stored count of 2, so both are rejected.
  * A statement containing a third genuine repeat: ordinals 0, 1, 2 -- the first
    two are already accounted for, the third imports.

The question is therefore not "does this row exist" but "do we already have this
many of it", which is the only formulation that separates a re-upload from a
genuine repeat purchase using content alone.

The key is written to a column with a unique index, so the database enforces it
rather than a pandas filter that only runs when someone remembers to call it.
