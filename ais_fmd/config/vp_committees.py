"""
Which budget lines each VP's committee owns.

The website lists six committees, each with one VP. The app books money to 18
finer-grained budget lines (`config/categories.py`). A VP should see the money
for everything their committee owns, so this file says which lines roll up into
which committee.

PROVISIONAL. This mapping is a proposal that the treasurer has not confirmed.
Nothing here decides where money is booked -- it only decides which lines are
added together on a VP's page -- but a wrong line here shows a VP the wrong
budget, so confirm it before real VPs sign in. Each entry says how sure it is.

Not listed on purpose:
  * Finance (Treasury, line 2) -- the treasurer's own full view, not a VP page.
  * Operations -- no budget line is obviously theirs yet; awaiting the treasurer.
  * Passport (line 16) -- treated as outside the six committees. A VP never sees
    its transactions; only the treasurer does. Unconfirmed.

No committee currently owns more than one line, but the roll-up (a committee that
adds several lines together) is kept and tested, for the day one does.
A committee that is not listed falls back to showing just its own single line,
exactly as before, so an unmapped VP still sees something correct.

The shared ufais.org officer mailboxes are mapped to a role and committee in
officer_roster.json (2026-10-26); anyone else is added on the Officer Access page.
