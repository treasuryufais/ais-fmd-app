"""
Roles and access control.

FINDING F2. The original had open registration -- anyone reaching the URL could
create an account and read the organisation's complete financial history -- and
gated the treasury portal, which grants unrestricted service-role writes, behind
a single shared password compared with `==`. There were no roles, so there was
no way to give a committee chair sight of their own budget without giving them
everything.

The model here is role-based: every page declares the role it needs, and the
check happens in one place. In production `current_user()` would read a Supabase
session and look the role up in a `profiles` table with RLS enforcing it
server-side; the sandbox lets you switch roles from the sidebar so the gating
is actually testable without standing up an auth provider.

The important part is the *shape*: authorisation is a property of the user, not
a secret that gets shared around a committee and never rotated.

         flow (Authlib) -- Supabase Auth is not involved, because the app
         talks to Supabase with its own service/anon key regardless of who is
         using it. A signed-in Google identity is looked up by email in
         `profiles`; a hit becomes that person's real role and committee, a

         wrong email in `profiles` should look like an error, not like reduced
         access.

         fallback that cannot be broken by a typo in `profiles` or by Google
         being unconfigured -- the treasurer is never locked out by this
         feature landing.
