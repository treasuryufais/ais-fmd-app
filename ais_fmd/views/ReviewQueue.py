"""
Module M3 -- categorization review queue.

Replaces "categorize everything, then eyeball a 200-row grid". Uncategorized
transactions are worked one at a time, highest-value first, with the reason the
categorizer could not resolve them shown alongside.

Every decision is logged as a label (M19), with what the categorizer proposed
beside what the treasurer chose, so spot-checks and evaluation can measure how
often the categorizer is right. Decisions no longer become merchant rules:
treasury ruled merchant memory out of categorization on 2026-09-23 (see
`pipeline.py`), so the way to shrink this queue is an accurate card roster.
