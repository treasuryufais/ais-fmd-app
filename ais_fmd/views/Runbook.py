Module M16 -- handoff runbook.

Bus-factor insurance. A student treasury committee turns over every year or two,
and the knowledge that usually leaves with the outgoing treasurer is not how the
code works — it is the *operational* knowledge: what order to do things in, what
to do when a bank changes its export, where the secrets live.

Parts of it read live state, so it describes the system as it is rather than as
it was when someone last edited a wiki page.

#### The monthly routine

Roughly 20 minutes if nothing is unusual.

**1. Export the statements.** Wells Fargo checking as CSV; Venmo as CSV. Export
the full statement period, not a filtered view — the importer rejects duplicates,
so overlapping ranges are safe and gaps are not.

**2. Import them.** Treasury → Upload statement. The parser validates the file's
shape before reading it and will refuse a file whose layout it does not
recognise, rather than importing nonsense. Read any warning it shows.

**3. Record the statement balances.** Reconciliation → Record a statement period.
Take the opening and closing balance straight off the statement header. This is
the step that catches a missing import, and it is the one most often skipped.

**4. Work the review queue.** Review Queue, largest amounts first. Leave
"Remember this merchant" ticked — each correction teaches the merchant table, so
the queue shrinks every month instead of regenerating at the same size.

**5. Check alerts.** Alerts & Reports → Alerts. Anything critical should be
resolved or explained before you stop.

**6. Attach receipts.** Reimbursements → Receipt coverage, for anything large
that lacks one. Far easier now than at audit time.

#### Closing a term

Do these in order. Locking is last because it makes the period read-only.

1. **Import every statement** covering the term. Check Reconciliation shows no
   activity gaps.
2. **Reconcile every period.** Every statement period should balance. An
   unexplained gap means a transaction is missing, not that the maths is wrong.
3. **Clear the review queue** for that term, or accept what remains knowingly —
   uncategorized spending is excluded from budget-vs-actual, so committee figures
   understate reality while anything is outstanding.
4. **Resolve outstanding reimbursements.** Approved-but-unpaid requests are
   money committed but not yet reflected.
5. **Generate the board pack** (Alerts & Reports → Board pack) and file it.
6. **Lock the term** (Treasury → Terms). After this, transactions dated inside it
   cannot be edited or imported until someone reopens it — enforced in the data
   layer, so no page can bypass it.

#### When something breaks

**A statement is rejected on import.**
The bank changed its export layout. The error names which columns it could not
identify. Open the CSV and check the header row against
`ais_fmd/domain/parsers/wells_fargo.py`, which documents both layouts it accepts.
This has happened before: the file that prompted the current parser had
`DESCRIPTION` and `AMOUNT` in the opposite positions from what the old code
assumed, and the old code imported every transaction as \$0.00 without complaint.

**Transactions import but the amounts look wrong.**
Stop and do not categorize them. Check for \$0.00 rows on the Data Quality page —
a cluster of them is the fingerprint of a misread column. Delete the import and
fix the parser before continuing.

**A period will not reconcile.**
The ledger and the bank disagree. In order of likelihood: a statement was never
imported; a statement was imported twice under different filenames; the opening
balance was typed wrong. The Reconciliation page shows activity gaps, which point
at the first case.

**Everything is uncategorized after an import.**
The rules did not fire. Most often this means the description format changed —
the categorizer reads the purchase date out of the description, and if that
pattern moves, the meeting-food rule stops matching.

**The app will not start.**
Check the Python version (3.13 is what it was built against) and that the venv is
activated. `python -m pytest` will localise a real breakage quickly.

Written down because they look like bugs otherwise:

- **Two purpose mappings contradict the reference table** — "Professional

  `PURPOSE_TO_COMMITTEE`.
- **Duplicate detection asks "do we already have this many of it"**, not "does
  this row exist" — so two genuine identical same-day purchases both import,
  while re-uploading a statement imports nothing.
- **Venmo and Zelle transfers never create merchant rules.** They are
  person-specific; learning them would make one useless rule per member.
- **Uncategorized dues still count** toward collection figures, so the total is
  not understated purely because nobody has worked the review queue.
