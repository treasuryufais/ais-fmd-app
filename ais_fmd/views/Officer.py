"""
Module M11 -- committee officer portal.

A VP's version of the org-wide Dashboard: the same four questions -- how am I
doing against budget, where did the money go, how does this term compare with
past ones, and am I on pace -- answered for one committee, and only that one.

A committee can own several budget lines (Membership owns Membership and
Passport), so every figure here is about all of them together; `config/
vp_committees.py` says which lines belong. The committee comes from the signed-in
profile, never from a widget a VP could change, and the page only ever reads rows
booked to that committee's lines.

This is the page that depends on FINDING F2 being fixed. Under the original
shared-password model there was no way to give a chair sight of their own budget
without handing them the keys to everything.
